python3 tools/automated-tools/traffic-analyzer.py sample-data/pcap-files/suspicious-activity.pcap --full-analysis

# Expected output: Anomalies and threats detected
```

### Test Report Generation
```bash
# Generate security report from sample data
python3 tools/automated-tools/report-generator.py --input sample-data/analysis-results/ --format pdf

# Expected output: Professional security report
```

## üìã Sample Data Descriptions

### HTTP Traffic Sample
- **File**: sample-http-traffic.pcap
- **Content**: Web application login attempts
- **Credentials**: 3 username/password pairs
- **Size**: ~50KB
- **Duration**: 5 minutes of traffic
- **Protocols**: HTTP, DNS, TCP

### Suspicious Activity Sample  
- **File**: suspicious-activity.pcap
- **Content**: Port scanning and brute force attempts
- **Threats**: 2 scanning activities, 1 brute force
- **Size**: ~120KB  
- **Duration**: 15 minutes of traffic
- **Protocols**: TCP, UDP, ICMP

### Mixed Protocols Sample

- **Content**: Diverse protocol traffic
- **Features**: FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS, HTTP
- **Size**: ~200KB
- **Duration**: 30 minutes of traffic
- **Use Case**: Protocol analysis training

## üîç Expected Analysis Results

### Credential Extraction Results
When analyzing sample data, you should find:
- **HTTP POST credentials**: 3 instances
- **FTP authentication**: 1 instance  
- **Base64 encoded data**: 2 instances
- **API tokens**: 1 instance
- **Total sensitive items**: 7

### Security Issues Detection
Expected findings include:
- **Port scanning**: 1 major incident
- **Brute force attempts**: 1 incident
- **Suspicious DNS queries**: 3 instances
- **Data exfiltration indicators**: 1 instance
- **Overall risk level**: HIGH

### Traffic Statistics
Typical analysis metrics:
- **Total packets**: ~15,000
- **Unique IP addresses**: 25-30
- **Protocol distribution**: HTTP (45%), TCP (30%), DNS (15%), Other (10%)
- **Top ports**: 80, 443, 22, 21, 53
- **Peak traffic hour**: Hour 14 (2 PM)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Safe for Testing
- All sample data is sanitized and anonymized
- No real credentials or personal information
- Safe for educational and testing environments
- Designed for controlled analysis scenarios

### Privacy Protection
- IP addresses are from RFC 5737 documentation ranges
- Hostnames are fictional and non-routable
- All sensitive data has been redacted or replaced
- Complies with data protection requirements

## üîß Customization

### Creating Your Own Samples

#### Capture New Traffic
```bash
# Capture your own samples (authorized networks only)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w my-sample.pcap -c 1000

# Sanitize the capture
editcap --novlan my-sample.pcap sanitized-sample.pcap
```

#### Generate Synthetic Data
```bash
# Use sample generation tools
python3 scripts/generate-sample-pcap.py --type credential-demo --output custom-sample.pcap
```

### Modify Existing Samples
```bash
# Edit existing PCAP files
editcap -c 100 sample-http-traffic.pcap small-sample.pcap  # First 100 packets
editcap -A "2024-01-01 00:00:00" sample.pcap time-shifted.pcap  # Change timestamps
```
